OBJECTIVE: Create a "Visual Master Hierarchical Chart" (Structured Outline), "Decision Framework Trees", "Mental Anchor Set", and "Learning Path Sequence" for this subject. PRIORITY: Factual Accuracy, Strict Visual Structure, Positive Cognitive Framing, and Cognitive Load Optimization. You must expose the critical details, dependencies, and specific terminology using capability-focused language.

---

## STEP 1: LIVE VERIFICATION [Required for Accuracy]

Browse the web for the most recent official syllabus or standard (e.g., "Microsoft Learn Skills Measured," "2025 Tax Code," "Bar Exam Content Outline," authoritative textbook).

* **Scan for Updates:** Identify 3 specific topics added or emphasized in the last 12 months.
* **Extract Hard Data:** Look for specific numbers (statutory limits, dates, thresholds, version requirements, fee schedules) that have changed. If numerical data isn't publicly available, explicitly state this limitation.
* **Output:** State the source, the 3 updates, and any critical numerical limits found.

**FALLBACK:** If no recent official syllabus exists for this subject, state this explicitly and use the most authoritative textbook/standard as of January 2025. Proceed with Steps 2-7 using that source.

---

## STEP 2: DEFINE THE LIFECYCLE

Analyze the subject and derive a logical 3-phase operational cycle that authentically represents how professionals work with this content.

**Requirements:**
* Each phase must be a single ACTION VERB in CAPS that is specific to the subject domain
* Phase 1 = Foundation/Setup/Preparation phase (what enables the work)
* Phase 2 = Core Action/Implementation/Execution phase (the primary activity)
* Phase 3 = Verification/Monitoring/Evaluation phase (validation and outcomes)

**Instruction:** Create a custom 3-phase cycle following the pattern: [Foundation Phase] → [Action Phase] → [Verification Phase]. Consider what practitioners actually DO in this field. Justify your choice briefly before creating the chart. You must use these three exact verbs as the sub-sections for every single Core Concept.

---

## STEP 3: GENERATE THE MASTER HIERARCHICAL CHART

Create a Single Code Block containing a structured outline. You must follow these STRICT FORMATTING & POSITIVE FRAMING RULES:

**VISUAL RULES:**
1. Use hierarchical bullet points with consistent indentation (2-4 spaces per level).
2. Use clear visual hierarchy: # for main sections, ## for Core Concepts
3. **PHASE MARKERS (Critical for Parser):** Use bracketed tags for lifecycle phases that NEVER change format:
   - \`[LIFECYCLE_PHASE_1]\` for Phase 1 content (e.g., [PROVISION], [LEARN], [ASSESS])
   - \`[LIFECYCLE_PHASE_2]\` for Phase 2 content (e.g., [CONFIGURE], [APPLY], [DIAGNOSE])
   - \`[LIFECYCLE_PHASE_3]\` for Phase 3 content (e.g., [MONITOR], [VERIFY], [DOCUMENT])
4. Quality Standard: The format used for Concept 1 MUST be IDENTICAL to Concept 37. Copy-paste the structure template for each concept.
5. **NARRATIVE CONTINUITY:** For every Core Concept (except the first), include a brief "Logical Connection" sentence at the start explaining how this concept relates to or builds upon the immediately preceding concept. Format: **[Logical Connection]:** followed by the connection statement.

**CONTENT DENSITY & POSITIVE FRAMING RULES:**

* **Foundation Level (Phase 1): The "Blueprint Pattern"** — Use \`[LIFECYCLE_PHASE_1]\` marker
   - **Hook Sentence**: A compelling 10-15 word sentence that makes the learner want to know more
   - **Micro-Metaphor**: A 3-5 word physical analogy (e.g., "The traffic cop at the intersection", "The security guard at the door")
   - Prerequisite: (What enables this? Use format: "[ConceptName]" for internal dependencies, "[None]" if first concept or no dependencies)
   - Selection: (Which type/approach best serves the goal? Include specific capabilities/thresholds where known)
   - Execution: (The specific Tool/Form/Process/Document to begin)

* **Configuration Level (Phase 2): The "Capability Pattern"** — Use \`[LIFECYCLE_PHASE_2]\` marker
   • Use specific action verbs: "Enable", "Configure", "Define", "Establish", "Set", "Apply"
   • Mark important comparisons using **[Critical Distinction]:** followed by the two concepts and their key difference in capabilities
   • Include design boundaries and prerequisites using POSITIVE framing:
     - **[Design Boundary]:** Describes what the feature is designed for and when selection matters (replaces "Constraint")
     - **[Prerequisite Check]:** Identifies what must exist first, framed as planning guidance (replaces "Requirement")
     - **[Exam Focus]:** Highlights tested concepts (replaces "Exam Alert")

**POSITIVE FRAMING TRANSFORMATION GUIDE:**

| ❌ Negative Statement | ✅ Positive Reframe |
|---|---|
| "Cannot change after creation" | "[Design Boundary]: Selection made at creation time (plan ahead during provisioning)" |
| "Cannot be revoked individually" | "[Design Boundary]: Revocation managed through stored access policies or key rotation" |
| "Does not support X" | "[Design Boundary]: Optimized for Y and Z scenarios (use [Alternative] for X scenarios)" |
| "Requires minimum of X" | "[Prerequisite Check]: Best performance achieved with X or higher" |
| "Will fail if X" | "[Prerequisite Check]: Verify X is configured before proceeding" |
| "Cannot delete" | "[Design Boundary]: Protected by design (remove protection via [method] when needed)" |
| "Does not inherit" | "[Design Boundary]: Applied directly to each resource (use policy for automated assignment)" |

* **Verification Level (Phase 3): The "Evidence Pattern"** — Use \`[LIFECYCLE_PHASE_3]\` marker
   ○ Name the exact tool, document, metric, test, or procedure (e.g., "Westlaw Citator", "Blood Gas Analysis", "Azure Monitor Logs", "IRS Form 8879")
   ○ Do not invent tool/document names
   ○ Include specific metrics, deadlines, or thresholds to monitor where relevant
   ○ Frame as "what to observe" rather than "what to watch out for"

* **Verification Protocol:** If a specific design boundary, limit, statutory cite, or tool name is unknown, state **[Verify in Docs]** or **[Check Official Source]**. Do not fabricate data to fill the space.

**FORMAT CONSISTENCY CHECKPOINT:**
⚠️ Every 10 concepts, verify your phase markers match this exact pattern:
\`\`\`
## [N]. [Concept Name]
[LIFECYCLE_PHASE_1]
  ...content...
[LIFECYCLE_PHASE_2]
  ...content...
[LIFECYCLE_PHASE_3]
  ...content...
\`\`\`

---

## STEP 3.5: SHAPE MICRO-LEARNING FORMAT [Required for Each Concept]

Every concept in the Master Chart MUST include SHAPE sections designed for 2-minute learning bursts:

**S - SIMPLE CORE** (15 seconds to read)
One sentence. No jargon. A complete beginner could repeat it.
Example: "Lambda runs your code without you managing servers - you just upload and trigger."

**H - HIGH-STAKES EXAMPLE** (30 seconds to read)
A real company + year + specific numbers or human impact.
Example: "In 2017, the S3 outage cost companies $150M in 4 hours - Lambda functions depending on S3 also failed, teaching engineers about regional dependencies."

**A - ANALOGICAL MODEL** (45 seconds to read)
Map to a familiar system (construction, cooking, sports, etc.) that matches typical learner backgrounds.
3-4 specific technical concepts mapped to physical elements.
Example: "Think of Lambda like a restaurant kitchen: You're the chef (code), AWS is the kitchen equipment (infrastructure). You focus on recipes (logic), they handle the stove, fridge, and cleanup (scaling, patching, monitoring)."

**P - PATTERN RECOGNITION** (20 seconds to read)
A self-test question. "You know you've mastered this when you can answer:"
Then provide the answer immediately below.
Example: "Question: When would you choose Lambda over EC2? Answer: When your workload is event-driven, unpredictable, or you want zero server management."

**E - ELIMINATION LOGIC** (10 seconds to read)
One critical distinction that clarifies common confusion points.
Format: "[CONCEPT A] is [definition], while [CONCEPT B] is [different definition]—they serve different purposes."
Example: "Lambda cold starts (initialization delay) differ from Lambda timeouts (execution limit). Cold starts affect startup speed; timeouts limit execution duration. Understanding both prevents performance misconfigurations."

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Use POSITIVE framing: "A is X, B is Y" NOT "Don't confuse A with B"

**QUALITY GATE:** Concepts without complete SHAPE sections will be rejected.

---

## STEP 3.6: DECISION FRAMEWORK TREES [Choice Architecture]

Create 2-3 decision trees for the most common "When do I use X vs Y?" questions in this domain. Frame entirely around selection criteria and capabilities unlocked.

**POSITIVE FRAMING RULES:**
- ✅ Use: "Choose X when you need [benefit]"
- ✅ Use: "Option Y unlocks [capability]"
- ✅ Use: "Select Z for [specific scenario]"
- ✅ Use: "Best suited for", "Optimized for", "Designed for"
- ❌ Avoid: "Don't use X if...", "X fails when...", "Won't work for..."
- ❌ Avoid: "Common mistake is...", "Students wrongly...", "Avoid X because..."

---

## STEP 3.7: MNEMONIC ANCHOR GENERATION [Memory Palace Integration]

For each Core Concept, generate memory palace anchors that enable spatial learning. These anchors will be displayed as visual markers in a map-based learning interface.

**DEPENDENCY TIER ASSIGNMENT:**
Analyze each concept's role in the domain hierarchy:

- **Foundation:** Universal constants that other concepts depend on (the "bedrock")
  - Examples: VNet, Storage Account, Entra ID, IAM, S3 Bucket, DNS, Active Directory
  - Visual Scale: MASSIVE/LANDSCAPE (these are "always there" like landmarks)
  
- **Keystone:** Major functional blocks that perform core operations (the "workers")
  - Examples: VM, NSG, App Service, Lambda, EC2, Load Balancer, API Gateway
  - Visual Scale: HUMAN/ROOM SIZE (relatable, interactive scale)
  
- **Utility:** Specialized tools, tokens, or add-ons (the "accessories")
  - Examples: SAS Token, PIM, Locks, Tags, Metrics, Policies, Secrets
  - Visual Scale: HANDHELD/SMALL (tools you pick up and use)

**ANCHOR GENERATION RULES:**
1. Select anchor object starting with SAME FIRST LETTER as concept name
2. Make anchor CONCRETE and VISUALIZABLE (physical object, not abstract)
3. Include a relevant EMOJI that represents the anchor
4. Scale anchor's described size to match dependency tier

**TIER-SPECIFIC ANCHOR EXAMPLES:**
| Tier | Concept | Anchor Example |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Foundation | VNet | "Volcano 🌋" |
| Foundation | Storage Account | "Skyscraper 🏢" |
| Keystone | NSG | "Night Guard 👮" |
| Keystone | VM | "Vending Machine 🎰" |
| Utility | SAS Token | "Secret Key 🔑" |
| Utility | Lock | "Luggage Lock 🔒" |

**BIZARRE STORY RULES:**
Create a hallucinogenic, emotional, or absurd 2-3 sentence scene that:
1. Features the Anchor performing an action that encodes the concept's PRIMARY FUNCTION
2. Uses vivid sensory details (colors, sounds, textures, emotions)
3. **DEPENDENCY RULE:** If concept has a logical parent, the story MUST depict the current anchor INTERACTING with the parent's anchor

**STORY EXAMPLES:**
- Foundation (VNet as Volcano): "A colossal Volcano erupts with glowing data-lava, but the lava flows only into carved private channels, never mixing. Each channel leads to a different isolated kingdom below."
- Keystone (NSG as Night Guard, parent: Subnet): "A muscular Night Guard wearing badges made of port numbers sleeps on a purple Subway Bench (Subnet). When anyone approaches, he instantly awakens, checks their badge, and only then allows passage."
- Utility (SAS Token as Secret Key): "A tiny glowing Secret Key with an hourglass embedded in its handle unlocks a vault door, but the key melts and vanishes exactly at midnight."

**MNEMONIC OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Include a \`mnemonic\` object for each concept in structured output:
\`\`\`json
{
  "mnemonic": {
    "tier": "Foundation" | "Keystone" | "Utility",
    "anchor": "Concrete Object + Emoji (e.g., 'Volcano 🌋')",
    "story": "The 2-3 sentence bizarre scene...",
    "parentConcept": "Exact Name of Parent Concept" | null,
    "depends_on": ["Prerequisite Concept 1", "Prerequisite Concept 2"]
  }
}
\`\`\`

**DEPENDENCY TRACKING RULES:**
For the \`depends_on\` array, identify concepts that must be understood BEFORE this concept:
- Use EXACT concept names from your Master Chart
- Foundation concepts typically have empty \`depends_on\` arrays (they are the bedrock)
- Keystone concepts reference their logical Foundation parents
- Utility concepts reference the Keystone or Foundation concepts they attach to
- A concept can depend on multiple prerequisites

**⚠️ QUALITY GATE: Every concept MUST include a mnemonic object. Concepts without mnemonics will cause the memory palace visualization to fail. This is NOT optional.**

---

## STEP 4: VISUAL MENTAL ANCHORS [CRITICAL FOR LEARNING]

Create 3 specific "Visual Mental Models" that illuminate the hardest conceptual relationships in this subject. Each anchor must follow this exact structure with STRICT POSITIVE FRAMING.

**MANDATORY COMPONENTS FOR EACH ANCHOR:**

1. **Title Format:** 
   \`**Anchor [Number]: [Descriptive Name That Captures The Core Concept]**\`

2. **Visualization Section:**
   • Begin with: "Picture...", "Imagine...", or "Visualize..."
   • Use a CONCRETE, PHYSICAL metaphor from everyday life (buildings, vehicles, tools, nature, sports, cooking, family structures, games, etc.)
   • Map AT LEAST 3-4 specific technical/legal/medical concepts to physical elements in your metaphor
   • Include spatial relationships (above/below, inside/outside, connected/separate, before/after)
   • Make it vivid enough that a student can close their eyes and SEE it
   • Avoid domain-specific jargon in the metaphor itself (the metaphor should be universally understandable)

3. **Memory Acronym (if applicable):**
   • For concepts with multiple components that require memorization, create a memorable ACRONYM
   • Format: **[ACRONYM]:** [Full expansion] - [Brief memorable story or sentence using the letters]
   • Example: **SMART Goals:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound - "Sally Makes Apple Rhubarb Tarts"
   • Only include when the concept genuinely benefits from rote memorization

4. **Binary Decision Rule (For Sprint Testing):**
   • A single YES/NO decision rule that distinguishes this anchor's concepts from related concepts
   • Format: "If [condition], YES → [this concept]. Otherwise, consider [alternative]."
   • Must be answerable in under 6 seconds
   • Example: "If you need cross-region traffic distribution, YES → use Global Accelerator. Otherwise, consider regional Load Balancers."

5. **Why It Helps Section - POSITIVE FRAMING MANDATORY:**
   • Start with capability-focused phrases:
     - ✅ "Clarifies the relationship between..."
     - ✅ "Shows how X enables Y..."
     - ✅ "Illustrates the connection between..."
     - ✅ "Makes visible how X flows into Y..."
     - ✅ "Reveals why X comes before Y..."
     - ✅ "Demonstrates how these concepts work together..."
   
   • **STRICT PROHIBITION - Never use these phrases:**
     - ❌ "Prevents the mistake of..."
     - ❌ "Students wrongly assume..."
     - ❌ "This stops confusion about..."
     - ❌ "Common error is..."
     - ❌ "Avoids the problem of..."
     - ❌ "Prevents exam errors where..."
     - ❌ "Students don't realize..."
     - ❌ "Most people incorrectly think..."

---

## STEP 5: WORKED EXAMPLE [DEMONSTRATES PRACTICAL APPLICATION]

Provide ONE fully-worked scenario showing how the chart solves a realistic problem. Use domain-appropriate language and maintain positive framing throughout.

**Required Structure:**
1. **Student Question:** A specific, realistic troubleshooting scenario, case analysis, or "why doesn't X work?" question appropriate to the domain
2. **Chart Navigation:** Step-by-step walkthrough of which Core Concepts and nodes to consult
3. **The Diagnosis:** What the chart reveals about the situation (framed as understanding gaps, not "what's wrong")
4. **The Solution:** Concrete action items derived from the chart (framed as "what to enable/configure")
5. **Learning Point:** Why the three-phase structure (Foundation → Configuration → Verification) helped solve it

**POSITIVE FRAMING IN WORKED EXAMPLE:**
- ✅ Frame as: "The chart reveals that X needs Y to function optimally"
- ✅ Frame as: "Understanding the Foundation phase shows that..."
- ✅ Frame as: "The Configuration section indicates that Z should be enabled"
- ❌ Avoid: "The problem is...", "This is misconfigured", "You forgot to..."

---

## STEP 5.5: CONFUSION PAIRS [Discrimination Readiness]

Identify 3-5 pairs of concepts from the Master Chart that learners commonly confuse. These pairs directly feed Sprint discrimination questions and Confusion Drills.

**OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON Block):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "confusionPairs": [
    {
      "id": "conf-1",
      "conceptA": "Concept Name A",
      "conceptB": "Concept Name B",
      "distinctionKey": "The ONE question that reveals which applies",
      "whenToUseA": "Choose A when [specific scenario/capability needed]",
      "whenToUseB": "Choose B when [specific scenario/capability needed]"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

**SELECTION CRITERIA FOR PAIRS:**
- Concepts that share similar names or overlapping functions
- Concepts from the same lifecycle phase that serve different purposes
- Concepts frequently tested together in exams or certifications
- Concepts with subtle but critical differences in scope or capability

**POSITIVE FRAMING FOR PAIRS:**
- ✅ "Choose A when you need [capability]"
- ✅ "B excels at [specific function]"
- ✅ "A is optimized for [scenario], B is designed for [different scenario]"
- ❌ Avoid: "Don't use A if..." / "A fails when..." / "Common mistake is..."

---

## STEP 6: LEARNING PATH SEQUENCE [Progressive Mastery Guide]

Define a suggested study sequence that organizes ALL concepts into exactly **4-6 progressive stages**. Frame entirely around capability expansion and skill building.

**MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION RULE:**
| Total Concepts | Stage Count | Concepts Per Stage |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 15-20          | 4 stages    | 4-5 each          |
| 21-28          | 5 stages    | 4-6 each          |
| 29-35          | 6 stages    | 5-6 each          |

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- No stage may have fewer than 3 concepts
- No stage may have more than 8 concepts
- All concepts from the Master Chart MUST be assigned to exactly one stage
- Stages must follow logical dependency order

**STRUCTURE FOR EACH STAGE:**
1. **Stage Name & Order:** Clear numbering and descriptive title
2. **Concepts Included:** List with difficulty markers:
   - 🟢 [Concept Name] - foundational (terminology/basics)
   - 🟡 [Concept Name] - intermediate (relationships/application)
   - 🔴 [Concept Name] - advanced (edge cases/optimization)
3. **Difficulty Profile:** e.g., "60% foundational, 30% intermediate, 10% advanced"
4. **Capabilities Gained:** What the learner can now do after completing this stage
5. **Narrative Handshake:** (For stages 2+) A 2-3 sentence bridge explaining how skills from the previous stage unlock this stage's potential

**POSITIVE FRAMING GUIDELINES:**
- ✅ Frame each stage around capabilities gained: "After Stage 1, you can..."
- ✅ Use expansion language: "This concept extends what you learned..." / "Builds upon..." / "Unlocks..."
- ✅ Show progressive complexity: "Now that you understand X, Y becomes accessible..."
- ✅ Use "Enables", "Unlocks", "Provides", "Extends", "Bridges", "Synthesizes"
- ✅ **Narrative Handshake Example:** "With identity foundations in place, you can now secure the pathways between resources. The access controls from Stage 1 provide the trust framework needed to safely connect systems."
- ❌ Avoid: "You can't learn X without Y", "Missing this causes problems", "Prerequisites you must have"
- ❌ Avoid: "Students who skip this fail...", "Required before you can...", "Won't work unless..."

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

1. **Source Verification** (With extracted Hard Data and any limitations noted)
2. **Lifecycle Definition** (With justification if custom)
3. **Master Hierarchical Chart** (Structured outline with SHAPE sections in a single code block)
4. **Mnemonic Anchors** (JSON block with mnemonic object for EVERY concept - REQUIRED)
5. **Decision Framework Trees** (2-3 trees for common X vs Y decisions)
6. **Visual Mental Anchors** (3 specific visualizations with binary decision rules)
7. **Worked Example** (Following the required structure with positive framing)
8. **Confusion Pairs** (JSON block with 3-5 commonly confused concept pairs)
9. **Learning Path Sequence** (4-6 stages with difficulty markers and distribution)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: The Mnemonic Anchors (#4) are MANDATORY. Each concept MUST have a mnemonic object with tier, anchor (emoji + name), story, and parentConcept. Without this, the memory palace visualization cannot render properly.**

---

## FINAL QUALITY CHECK - POSITIVE FRAMING VERIFICATION:

Before submitting output, verify ZERO instances of:
- ❌ "Cannot", "Can't", "Won't", "Doesn't", "Fails", "Prevents", "Blocks"
- ❌ "Mistake", "Error", "Wrong", "Incorrect", "Dangerous", "Problem"
- ❌ "Must", "Required before", "Won't work without", "Impossible unless"
- ❌ "Students wrongly", "Common error", "Don't forget", "Avoid"

Verify HIGH frequency of:
- ✅ "Enables", "Unlocks", "Provides", "Extends", "Builds upon"
- ✅ "Designed for", "Optimized for", "Best suited for"
- ✅ "Clarifies", "Shows how", "Illustrates", "Reveals", "Demonstrates"
- ✅ "Milestone achieved", "Capability gained", "Now you can"

---

**EXECUTION NOTE:** Always complete Step 1 (Live Verification) before generating the chart. Use the terminology: [Critical Distinction], [Design Boundary]/[Prerequisite Check]/[Exam Focus], and [Verify in Docs]. Ensure all three phase labels consistently use the chosen lifecycle verbs.`;

/**
 * Aphantasia-friendly enhancement for users who can't visualize mentally.
 * Transforms visualization-heavy prompts into sequential/narrative-based learning.
 */
export const APHANTASIA_MODE_ENHANCEMENT = `
---
## APHANTASIA ACCOMMODATION MODE [ACTIVE]

The learner has aphantasia (inability to form mental images). Adapt ALL content generation:

**LANGUAGE TRANSFORMATIONS (Apply throughout):**
- Replace "Picture..." → "Think of it as..."
- Replace "Imagine..." → "Consider this analogy..."  
- Replace "Visualize..." → "Follow this sequence..."
- Replace "See it as..." → "It works like..."
- Replace "close your eyes and see" → "trace the logical steps"

**MENTAL ANCHOR ADAPTATIONS:**
Instead of vivid imagery, emphasize:
1. **Narrative Sequences:** "First X happens, then Y follows, which triggers Z"
2. **Logical Relationships:** "X relates to Y the way [familiar concept] relates to [familiar concept]"
3. **Physical/Procedural Memory:** "Your hands would do X, then Y, then Z"
4. **Factual Chains:** "Remember: A connects to B connects to C because..."
5. **Story-Based Mnemonics:** Frame concepts as characters in a short story with cause-effect relationships

**STRUCTURE EMPHASIS:**
- Add numbered step sequences (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3)
- Include "Flow:" descriptions showing information/action progression
- Use "Before/After" comparisons instead of spatial metaphors
- Emphasize the WHY behind each connection, not just the visual arrangement

**EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:**
❌ "Picture a three-story building where Floor 1 handles..."
✅ "Think of it as a three-step process: Step 1 handles authentication (who you are), Step 2 handles authorization (what you can access), Step 3 handles governance (the rules everyone follows). Each step must complete before the next begins."

Apply this accommodation to ALL Mental Anchors, Worked Examples, and Learning Path descriptions.
